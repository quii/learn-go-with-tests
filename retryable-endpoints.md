# Retryable endpoints

We are building an API that does some _important business logic_ (we don't care about specifics in this chapter), and then follows it up by calling a SaaS email provider to send a confirmation. Bread and butter Go, at least on the happy path. But we're building a resilient [distributed system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing), so we need to think carefully about what happens when things go wrong.

Imagine a client is using a _[transactional outbox](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/transactional-outbox.html)_. If you're not familiar, it's enough to know that it's a list of pending work stored in a database. A worker picks up an item from the outbox, calls our API and then marks the item as done if the call succeeds.

What happens if the worker calls our API successfully, and then crashes before it can mark the item as done? When the worker restarts, it'll pick up the item, call the API again, and now we will accidentally send two confirmation emails.

What we need to do is make our API friendly for retries. A fancier term for this is **[idempotency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence#Computer_science_meaning)**: repeating the same logical operation has the same intended effect as doing it once. Retrying a request should not send another confirmation email, but two separate requests should still send two emails.

Sometimes we can design our APIs to be idempotent, almost out of the box. An [HTTP PUT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP#Idempotent_method)'s semantics mean you update a resource in place, and if you do the same call again, the state of the resource is the same. GET should also follow these retryable semantics.

For operations like sending an email, we need some help: **idempotency keys**. Let’s use TDD to see how they work.
